# Yes to GCL Campaign Website

This repo serves as a way to publish the information site for our campaign via Github Pages. The organizers in the "Yes" group is designing this website to help make it easier for members of our community to better understand the GCL project.

# How to contribute

## Post issues/bugs/requests

If there's a change you would like to see made, go to the "Issues" tab and click the green "New Issue" button. Next, enter a descriptive title for the issue in the "Title" bar and fill the text book on the "Write" table labeled "Leave a comment" with a detailed description of the issue. The more detailed and specific the issue comment text, more likily either I or another volunteer will prompty resolve it. If you just want to change the text contents on the page, be descriptive and precise in explaining where the altered text should be placed on the site, the give the exact text you wish to see there. I'm just copy-and-pasting your content into the html of the site, so if there's any typos, it's your fault ;)

## Modify code/contents

If you're addressing an issue posted to the github repo, please add yourself to the list of "assignees" in the issue either by clicking the gear icon or clicking the text button "assign yourself." If you're proposing a new change, you can skip using the issues feature on github and just make the pull request, but when doing so, make sure you are very descriptive in what changes you are proposing.

Start on the main branch and create a new branch, then git checkout your new branch. Make all the changes you want on this new branch. When you're done making changes, or just want to back up changes, push your branch.

When you're ready to have your changes merged into the published site, create a Pull Request to merge your branch into the protected branch "main." I'll first test your changes and leave comments on the Pull Request if anything needs to be fixed. Once it's ready, I'll accept your Pull Request and you should see your changes appear on the site within a few minutes.

## Additional help

# Misc

## Git

Git is a Version Control System (VCS) used to efficently track changes to code and facilitate collobration between multiple people making changes to the same code. If you want to work on this website, first you need to clone the repo onto your computer. From there, you can test changes to the site without changing the actual published site. You can open the index.html file in your browser to test what the published site will look like. If you need help understanding git, google is your friend, but this [online guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) is great resource.

Say hello to Stellar, a slick little one-pager with a super vibrant color palette (which
I guess you can always tone down if it's a little too vibrant for you), a "sticky" in-page
nav bar (powered by my Scrollex plugin), a separate generic page template (just in case
you need one), and an assortment of pre-styled elements.
